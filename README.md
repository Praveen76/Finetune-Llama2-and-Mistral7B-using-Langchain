# Finetune-Llama2-and-Mistral7B-using-Langchain

This repository provides a detailed Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use and fine-tune large language models (LLMs) like Llama2 and Mistral7B via LangChain. The notebook is designed to guide users through the process of integrating these models with advanced LangChain features.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this experiment, you will be able to:
- Utilize open-source LLMs such as zephyr-7b-beta, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, and Llama2 through the Hugging Face Hub with LangChain.
- Understand and implement the concepts of Prompt Templates, Memory, and Output Parsers in LangChain.

## Files

- `Finetune-Llama2-and-Mistral7B-using-Langchain.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that includes all the code and detailed instructions.

## How to Use

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- `transformers`
- `langchain`

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
```bash
